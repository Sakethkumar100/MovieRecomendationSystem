🎬 Movie Recommendation System
A robust AI-powered Movie Recommendation System that uses Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Hybrid Models to generate personalized video suggestions based on user preferences, demographics, and viewing habits.

📌 Overview
In the age of digital streaming, users are often overwhelmed with content. This project tackles the problem by building an intelligent recommendation engine that:

Analyzes historical user behavior.

Predicts future preferences using ML models.

Suggests relevant movies using hybrid filtering approaches.

🧠 Features
User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Matrix Factorization (SVD, NMF)

TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity for Metadata

Hybrid Filtering (Content + Collaborative)

Cold Start & Sparsity Mitigation

Real-Time Web Deployment using Flask

📊 Dataset
MovieLens 1M dataset (1 million ratings from 6,000 users on 4,000 movies)

Movie metadata: genres, keywords, cast, production companies, language, popularity, and more.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Flask

Similarity Metrics: Cosine Similarity, RMSE, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Storage: CSV/SQL support for dynamic data access

Deployment: Flask-based web interface

⚙️ Methodologies
🔄 Collaborative Filtering
User-User Filtering: Recommends movies by finding users with similar tastes.

Item-Item Filtering: Suggests similar movies based on ratings from like-minded users.

🧮 Matrix Factorization
Reduces dimensionality using SVD and NMF for performance and latent factor detection.

🧠 Hybrid Models
Combines metadata (genre, cast, etc.) with collaborative insights to overcome the cold-start problem.

📈 Performance Metrics
RMSE: 0.89 – 0.92

Precision: 75% – 78%

Recall: 72% – 74%

F1 Score: ~76%

MAP: Used to evaluate ranking quality

🔥 Challenges Addressed
Cold start for new users and movies

Data sparsity and bias

Scalability with large datasets

Real-time performance limitations

Personalization for shared profiles

✅ Evaluation & Results
The model was evaluated on multiple metrics and achieved solid performance. Item-based collaborative filtering outperformed other methods with:

RMSE: 0.89

Precision: 78%

F1-Score: 76%

💡 Future Enhancements
Add advanced filters (genre, cast preferences)

Context-aware recommendations (time, location, mood)

Real-time feedback loop integration

Explainable AI for transparency

Trend-based adaptive recommendations
